# Celeste 64 Fuji Level Template
This is a template for a level mod for the Celeste 64 Fuji Mod Loader. This includes a basic main area map, and a cassette map with some simple platforms and a strawberry. Feel free to edit, delete, and copy these levels as needed.

## Installing the template
To get started, you may either `git clone` the template, or click the green "Use this template" button on the repository home page [(direct link)](https://github.com/new?template_name=Code-Mod-Template&template_owner=FujiAPI) to add it as a repository on your GitHub account.

If you do not wish to use git, you can also just [download this template project as a zip](https://github.com/FujiAPI/Code-Mod-Template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it.

It is recommended to put the mod into the Mods folder of your fuji installation, and rename the mod folder to something unique.

# Getting Started
Before you start working with this template, you should know how Fuji mods are set up. See https://github.com/FujiAPI/Fuji/wiki/Mod-Setup-Basics

These maps can be opened and edited using the Trenchbroom level editor. See here for more information regarding how to work with Trenchbroom and create custom maps:
https://github.com/FujiAPI/Fuji/wiki/Creating-Custom-Maps

Make sure you update both the `Fuji.json` file and the `Levels.json` file to properly describe the contents of your mod.

# Structure
- You can find your map files in `/Maps`
- See the map's dialog and localisation strings in `/Text`
- You may replace the texture in `Textures/Postcards/LevelTemplate.png` with your own PNG file, then update `Levels.json` accordingly

When you are done making your map, and are ready to publish it, you can either delete this readme file, or edit it if desired.

Note: This template is still a work in progress, and may change and evolve over time.
