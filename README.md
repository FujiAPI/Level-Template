# Celeste 64 Fuji Level Template
This is a template for a level mod for the Celeste 64 Fuji Mod Loader. This includes a basic cassette map with some simple platforms and a strawberry.

# Getting Started
Before you start working with this template, you should know how Fuji mods are set up. See https://github.com/FujiAPI/Fuji/wiki/Mod-Setup-Basics

This map can be opened and edited using the Trenchbroom level editor. See here for more information regarding how to work with Trenchbroom and create custom maps:

# Structure
- You can find your map files in `/Maps`.
- See the map's dialog and localisation strings in `/Text`
- You may replace the texture in `Textures/Postcards/LevelTemplate.png` with your own PNG file, then update `Levels.json` accordingly.

When you are done making your map, and are ready to publish it, you can either delete this readme file, or edit it if desired.

Note: This template is still a work in progress, and may change and evolve over time.
