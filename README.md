# Celeste 64 Fuji Level Template
This is a Template for a level mod for the Celeste 64 Fuji Mod Loader. This includes a basic cassette map with some simple platforms and a strawberry.

This map can be opened and editted using the trenchbroom level editor. See here for more information regarding how to work with trenchbroom and create custom maps:

When you are done making your map, and are ready to publish it, you can either delete this readme file, or edit it if desired.

Note: This template is still a work in progress, an may change and evolve over time.
